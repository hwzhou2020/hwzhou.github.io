# To "SEE" the World with Optics and Computations

I am a graduate student in Electro-Optics and Photonics at the University of Dayton, OH, US. Prior to my study at Dayton, I got my Bachelor's degree in optoelectronics at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China. I have a background in math, physics, optics, signal processing, electronics, programming (especially proficient in Matlab). I am highly interested in 3D imaging, phase imaging, computational imaging, optical imaging, holographic display, 3D display, etc. I wish to visualize the world with optical devices, combining with numerical computations. 

As a master student, I am currently working on the transport of intensity equation (TIE). (1) Phase retrieval using TIE with digital holography (DH); (2) A non-iterative FFT-based TIE phase retrieval method with error correction using the transport of phase equation (TPE).

Apart from academics, I am a fan of jogging, table tennis, and photography. Running best records (1) 400m: 61s (2013); (2) 2000m: 7min50s (2016). Table tennis: most active in 2003-2009. Photography: an amateur level, a recent hobby.
